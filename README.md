# OpenGD77 User Guides

This repository contains the English and Chinese versions of the OpenGD77 / OpenGD77S / OpenDM1801 / OpenRD5R User Guide

These files are taken from the last release of the OpenGD77 combined firmware, documents and tools repository.

The User Guides are now in this separate repository because of software license issues with the overall OpenGD77 repository

These files are still covered under the same software license (GPL 2), as the original OpenGD77 repository used.
